ePub Stylesheets
================

This project contains a small collection of stylesheets suitable for styling
eBooks conforming to the ePub 2.1 specification. I have tested the styles in the
Sigil ePub editor, as well as on the Barnes and Noble Nook Simple Touch, and the
Aldiko Reader application for Android (on both the ASUS Nexus 7 tablet, and HTC
One V smartphone).

The stylesheets are distributed under the terms of the MIT License. As such, you
are free to use them as you wish - even in commercial or for-profit projects.
There is no requirement to list me as a contributor to the project anywhere in
the text portion. However, the license statement at the beginning of any CSS
files must remain in place (which is only visible when editing the file). The
full text of the license is included at the bottom of this document.

## Available Stylesheets

* *Screenplay.css* - Hollywood-style screenplays
* *MLA* - long-form essays for school (with citations)
* *APA* - long-form papers for college (with title page, multiple sections, and
  citations)

## Using the Stylesheets

First, add a minified copy of the appropriate stylesheet to your ePub project,
and link to it in each HTML file that will use the styles. To apply the styles,
add the appropriate CSS classes to your HTML elements.

### Screenplay

The Screenplay stylesheet was designed to be mostly compatible with the HTML
source generated by the Celtx screenwriting software. However, for the
convenience of those writing screenplay HTML from scratch, you will need to
remove line breaks from the end of each paragraph, and remove the parentheses
from around parentheticals.

This stylesheet specifies the following classes:

* *.sceneheading* - for sluglines (e.g. INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY)
* *.action* - for descriptions and action
* *.character* - the name of the character who is speaking
* *.continued* - adds (CONT'D) at the end of the line
* *.parenthetical* - emotion or action added to dialog
* *.dialog* - the character's lines
* *.transition* - cuts, dissolves, fades, etc.
