ePub Stylesheets
================

This project contains a small collection of stylesheets suitable for styling eBooks conforming to the ePub 2.1 specification.

## Available Stylesheets

* *screenplay.css* - Hollywood-style screenplays
* *modern-report.css* - for academic essays conforming to the MLA guidelines

### Screenplay

The Screenplay stylesheet provides the necessary rules for creating a Hollywood-style script.

While the industry standard format for screenplays is based on fixed measurements relative to US Letter sized pages, this stylesheet employs percentage-based sizing, in order to accomodate the varied display sizes of ePub compatible devices. When printing to 8.5"x11" pages, the standard size is preserved. Other devices approximate the standard format, using the available screen space.

This stylesheet was designed to be compatible with the HTML source generated by the Celtx screenwriting software. For best results, you can remove the extraneous line breaks that Celtx tends to add at the end of paragraphs.

This stylesheet specifies the following classes:

* *.sceneheading* - for sluglines (e.g. INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY)
* *.action* - for descriptions and action
* *.character* - the name of the character who is speaking
* *.continued* - adds (CONT'D) at the end of the line
* *.parenthetical* - emotion or action added to dialog
* *.dialog* - the character's lines
* *.transition* - cuts, dissolves, fades, etc.

Additional classes are available for creating title pages.

### Modern Report

The Modern Report stylesheet provides a skeleton for creating reports conforming to the MLA guidelines. Note, however, that these formatting rules are not a magic bullet, and will not account for all aspects of the format.

The stylesheet does provide correct spacing, paragraph indentation, frontmatter, a title class, and a class for bibliographic citations. Due to current limitations, we cannot provide the running header for each page, nor can we provide automatically numbered headings.

* All tagged paragraphs and headings in the document will be double spaced, set in Times New Roman, Georgia, or a serif typeface
* Use the *.frontmatter* class for the name, instructor's name, course, and date at the beginning of the paper
    - These can be individual paragraphs with the *.frontmatter* class, or a single paragraph split with &lt;br /&gt; tags
* The *.title* class is used for the title of the paper, and to denote the end notes, and works cited sections
* Long quotes use the blockquote tag
* Bibliographic citations use the *.citation* class

Any code contributions that do not adhere to these guidelines will be removed from the source tree.
