ePub Stylesheets
================

This project contains a small collection of stylesheets suitable for styling
eBooks conforming to the ePub 2.1 specification. I have tested the styles in the
Sigil ePub editor, as well as on the Barnes and Noble Nook Simple Touch, and the
Aldiko Reader application for Android (on both the ASUS Nexus 7 tablet, and HTC
One V smartphone).

## Available Stylesheets

* *Screenplay.css* - Hollywood-style screenplays
* *MLA* - long-form essays for school (with citations)
* *APA* - long-form papers for college (with title page, multiple sections, and
  citations)
