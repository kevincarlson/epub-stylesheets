ePub Stylesheets
================

This project contains a small collection of stylesheets suitable for styling
eBooks conforming to the ePub 2.1 specification. I have tested the styles in the
Sigil ePub editor, as well as on the Barnes and Noble Nook Simple Touch, and the
Aldiko Reader application for Android (on both the ASUS Nexus 7 tablet, and HTC
First smartphone).

The stylesheets are distributed under the terms of the MIT License. As such, you
are free to use them as you wish - even in commercial or for-profit projects.
There is no requirement to list me as a contributor to the project anywhere in
the text portion. However, the license statement at the beginning of any CSS
files must remain in place (which is only visible when editing the file). The
full text of the license is included at the bottom of this document.

## Available Stylesheets

* *screenplay.css* - Hollywood-style screenplays
* *modern-report.css* - for academic essays conforming to the MLA guidelines
* *longform-report.css* - for long-form academic essays conforming to the APA guidelines

## Using the Stylesheets
The stylesheets can be used as they appear in the src directory. Each one is annotated to facilitate integrating it into the document. For this reason, it is recommended that you minify the stylesheets before publication, to remove extra whitespace and comments that are not necessary for the finished document. This step is optional.

In order to use the formatting, be sure to link to the stylesheet in the &lt;head&gt; element of each HTML section, and apply the necessary styles to each element in the document.

### Screenplay

The Screenplay stylesheet was designed to be mostly compatible with the HTML source generated by the Celtx screenwriting software. For best results, you can remove the extraneous line breaks that Celtx tends to add at the end of paragraphs.

This stylesheet specifies the following classes:

* *.sceneheading* - for sluglines (e.g. INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY)
* *.action* - for descriptions and action
* *.character* - the name of the character who is speaking
* *.continued* - adds (CONT'D) at the end of the line
* *.parenthetical* - emotion or action added to dialog
* *.dialog* - the character's lines
* *.transition* - cuts, dissolves, fades, etc.

Additional classes are available for creating title pages for screenplays.

### Modern Report

This stylesheet is currently under construction.

### Longform Report

This is also under construction.
